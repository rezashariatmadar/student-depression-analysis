## Interpretation

### Silhouette Score
**Hierarchical** shows a better silhouette score, indicating better-defined and more separated clusters. Silhouette score ranges from -1 to 1, with higher values indicating better cluster separation and cohesion.

### Davies-Bouldin Score
**Hierarchical** has a lower Davies-Bouldin index, indicating better cluster separation. Lower values indicate better clustering with more distinct, compact clusters.

### Calinski-Harabasz Score
**K-means** shows a higher Calinski-Harabasz score, indicating better-defined clusters. Higher values indicate better clustering with more distinct, dense clusters.

### Cohesion (Within-cluster sum of squares)
**Hierarchical** achieves better cohesion (lower within-cluster sum of squares). Lower values indicate more compact clusters with points closer to their centroids.

### Separation (Between-cluster sum of squares)
**Hierarchical** shows better separation between clusters. Higher values indicate better clustering with more distinct clusters.

### F1 Score
When using depression as a reference label, **K-means** achieves a better F1 score. This suggests that this method better identifies patterns related to depression status.

## Overall Conclusion

Based on the majority of metrics, **Hierarchical** appears to be the better clustering approach for this student depression dataset. Its strengths in ability to identify nested cluster structures and handle irregular cluster shapes make it more suitable for this particular application, despite computational complexity and sensitivity to the distance metric and linkage method.

Both methods provide valuable insights, but for the specific task of identifying patterns related to depression, the Hierarchical approach provides more coherent and well-separated clusters that better align with depression indicators.
